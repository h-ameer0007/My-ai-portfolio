# 👋 Hi, I'm Ameer Hamza

## 🛠️ Repair Tech by Day | 💻 AI Integration Engineer in the Making by Night

Welcome to my journey — a real-time transformation from zero to AI Integration Engineer.

---

## 🌱 The Beginning: Rock Bottom is a Launchpad

I started from scratch — not from a computer science degree, not from a bootcamp, not from privilege — but from 12-hour work shifts as a mobile repair technician in Italy. I didn't grow up coding, and I never had a formal roadmap. What I had was **a fierce dream** and a **decision**:  
**I will build my future, line by line, script by script.**

One month ago, I wrote my first line of Python. Since then, I've been coding every day in the slivers of time life gives me — between shifts, on breaks, and late at night.

## 💡 The Goal: Become a Professional AI Integration Engineer

I'm not here to “learn Python.”  
I'm here to **master the tools** that will shape the next era — AI, automation, integration, systems thinking. My north star is to become a **professional AI Integration Engineer** capable of designing systems that combine traditional software with intelligent, self-improving components.

I want to:

- Understand how AI tools (like LLMs, APIs, and automations) can be embedded into real-world systems  
- Build internal tools and SaaS products that help people multiply their time and capabilities  
- Solve real problems through code  
- Work on impactful teams and never stop learning

## 🧗‍♂️ The Climb: Projects, Practice & Progress

Even with limited time, I’ve already built:

- `CLI Calculator` — My first ever project to get comfortable with inputs, control flow, and functions.
- `CLI File Utility Tool` — A step forward in understanding the file system, user interaction, and building utility tools.

Next up:

- Automating tasks with Python scripts  
- Integrating APIs into meaningful workflows  
- Learning web frameworks and building portfolio projects  
- Embedding AI tools (like OpenAI, LangChain, or similar) into real apps  
- Preparing for job-level skills by studying real job posts and mirroring tech stacks

## 🔥 What Drives Me

- I’m **self-taught**.
- I’m **relentless**.
- I don’t wait for “perfect conditions.”
- I believe in **compound effort** — that small, consistent steps change lives.

> “I may be behind in knowledge, but I’m ahead in hunger.”

If you’re a recruiter, team lead, or engineer reading this — know that what I lack in formal credentials, I make up for in **work ethic, clarity of vision**, and the **ability to learn fast under pressure**. I’ve been fixing phones. Now I’m fixing my future.
