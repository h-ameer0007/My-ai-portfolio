This calculator checks if the user provided input is a digit and if not if returns with an error message to provide a number.
it is consistent with the option selection range with numbers. if the number is outside of the range it returns with a message 
to select a number from the range. the loop keeps providing with the menu selection.
it first checks if the user has selected the quit command and quits the program with a message. 
If the user selects a number to perform an opration it asks for the numbers to be used to perform the opration.
If the user does not select the option to quit, the program keeps running to allow user to perform multiple oprations one after the other untill quit.
It handles the devide by zero error as well by displaying a message "can not devide by zero" and then displays the selection menu to continue.
